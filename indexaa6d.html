                        <div class="how_to_qa_des">For a given QR Code you may customize the shape, content, color, size, background image, logo image and container image. Our circular QR Codes with logo are the coolest and most popular, followed by heart shape QR codes. <br/> QR code can be static or dynamic. For dynamic code, you get many extra options such as <a href='qr-code-business-card.html'>vcard plus</a> cards, landing pages, forms, videos and many more.</div>

                        <h3 class="how_to_qa">What are dynamic QR codes?</h3>
                        <div class="how_to_qa_des"> Static QR Codes encode the final data which is displayed after a scan, for instance, the URL of the website.<br/><br/> However, Dynamic QR Codes embed a short link to the data, such as a short link to the URL of the website.<br/> So after scanning the QR your browser hits the short link which then translates to the URL of your website and opens in the browser. <br/><br/>Dynamic QR codes are very powerful; their content can be changed at any time, umpteen number of times without having to change the actual printed QR Code. This reduces the time, cost, and effort to re-print and re-distribute the new QR Codes. You may add an infinite amount of data against the QR Code and in any format, e.g., audio, video, images, AR, VR, and landing pages. <br/><br/>On Dynamic QR Codes, all the scans can be monitored and tracked, giving you a rich set of analytics to measure and improve the performance of your campaign(s). You may create Dynamic QR Codes through our QR Code generator software online.</div>
